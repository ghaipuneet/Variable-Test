Authorization and access control mechanisms are used to control who has access to what resources. In the context of a decentralized exchange, you will need to implement authorization and access control mechanisms to control who can:

Create accounts: Only authorized users should be able to create accounts on your exchange.
Deposit funds: Only authorized users should be able to deposit funds to their accounts on your exchange.
Withdraw funds: Only authorized users should be able to withdraw funds from their accounts on your exchange.
Trade assets: Only authorized users should be able to trade assets on your exchange.
View orders: Only authorized users should be able to view orders on your exchange.
Cancel orders: Only authorized users should be able to cancel orders on your exchange.
View balances: Only authorized users should be able to view their balances on your exchange.
There are a number of different ways to implement authorization and access control mechanisms. Some common methods include:

Role-based access control (RBAC): RBAC allows you to assign roles to users. Each role can have a set of permissions associated with it. For example, you could create a role called "trader" and give traders the permission to trade assets.
Rule-based access control (RBAC): RBAC allows you to create rules that determine who has access to what resources. For example, you could create a rule that says that only users who have deposited at least $100 can trade assets.
Attribute-based access control (ABAC): ABAC allows you to create rules that determine who has access to what resources based on the user's attributes. For example, you could create a rule that says that only users who are over the age of 18 can trade assets.
The best method for implementing authorization and access control mechanisms will depend on the specific needs of your exchange. However, all methods should be designed to protect user privacy and security.

Here are some of the things you need to keep in mind when implementing authorization and access control mechanisms:

Security: The authorization and access control mechanisms you implement should be secure. They should be designed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing resources.
Flexibility: The authorization and access control mechanisms you implement should be flexible. They should be able to be adapted to the changing needs of your exchange.
Usability: The authorization and access control mechanisms you implement should be easy to use. Users should be able to understand how they work and how to use them.
